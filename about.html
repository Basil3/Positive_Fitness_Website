 	<h2>About Us</h2><br>
	<br>
	After completing my Sport Science degree in New Zealand, I set off with a group of friends to London on what Kiwis refer to as their OE - Overseas Experience.
	It was these initial years in London that shaped my fitness career.  I gained great experience working as an Exercise Specialist in various Blue Chip companies throughout
	London, such as HSBC, Linklaters, Deutsche Bank, Diageo, GSK and many more.  During this time, I also worked as a mobile Personal Trainer throughout Central London, training
	a variety of clients ranging in age from 13 through to mid-sixties.  I also gained valuable experience working in an alternative Fitness Centre, which focussed on different
	ways of training clients.  All of the training revolved around vibration training, balance and mobility work.  It was also during my time in London that I completed
	the National Strength and Conditioning Association's Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist (CSCS) qualification.<br>
	<br>
	After leaving London, I returned to my native New Zealand for just over a year.  During this time, I had experience working in CityFitness, a new gym chain that was just 
	expanding.  This gave me a good insight into the commercial side of fitness, after mainly being involved in corporate fitness in London.<br>
	<br>
	From New Zealand, I then moved back to the UK, this time living in the North-East.  Over the next few years, I gained experience working as a Personal Trainer in two fitness
	facilities at the opposite end of the spectrum - a 5000 member Health and Racquet Club, as well as a boutique Personal Training studio.<br>
	<br>
	In 2011, I moved to Dublin.  For most of my time here, I have worked out of LA Fitness in Dartry, along with mobile Personal Training.  I'm now settled with two young
	boys who never fail to keep me on my toes!<br>
